## Notes

- Each task should be completed in order within its phase
- Phases can sometimes overlap (e.g., Phase 1 & 2 are both CRUD)
- Phase 4 (Recording) and Phase 5 (Execution) are the core features
- Always test with real frontend integration before marking complete

## Architecture

```
Project (has baseUrl)
├── Folder (just a name)
│   └── TestFile (has steps)
├── Folder
│   └── TestFile
```

- **Projects** have a name, description, and baseUrl
- **Folders** organize test files within a project (no nesting allowed)
- **Test Files** must belong to a folder (no root-level files)
- **Project Switcher** dropdown in top bar allows switching between projects
